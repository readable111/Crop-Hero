## Introduction <a name="intro"></a>
### Purpose of Project <a name="project_purpose"></a>
*Author: Daniel, Tyler*

The purpose of CropHero is to provide an accessible, easy-to-use mobile app for small-scale and hobbyist farmers. They should be able to record, track, and visualize crop data including days since planting, height, and other helpful information for growing crops and caring for livestock. The product will also act to aggregate data within the community for better yields and collaboration. 
### Purpose of MPM & Document Conventions  <a name="mpm_purpose"></a>
*Author: Daniel*

The Maintenance Procedures Manual is a formal document that establishes the general structure of the CropAlly application and general procedures to support it in the future. While conciseness is a consideration, rigor and detail is this documentâ€™s priority. By doing so, future maintainers and developers can achieve an exhaustive understanding of the CropAlly application. This helps ensure effective support without time wasted as they try to understand their predecessors' efforts. 

It is recommended that developers and maintainers expand the MPM while contributing to the code. This helps to ensure that the MPM is thorough and contains all relevant information. In addition, this can be considered an extension of rubber duck debugging. By explaining the logic behind your code as you write it, you should be able to identify potential problems. 

Each chapter in the document will be marked by a high-level header which will be Level 2. Section headers will be marked by a Level 3 header. Each subsequent header will be marked by a higher level header. Only the top three headers will be included in the table of contents: the chapter, section, and subsection headers.
### Client Overview & Intended Audience <a name="audience"></a>
*Author: Daniel*

The client is Zina Townley, a current product owner and release train engineer at L3Harris Technologies. Also, she is a former Scrum master, application support manager, IT manager, and programmer analyst. She and her husband created the Ashby-Browning Family Scholarship in Engineering at UNT. Importantly for this application, she is a hobbyist farmer who owns 11 acres. This marks her as a Lifestyle user according to our user class definitions. 

This maintenance manual is meant to help the client and any future developers on this project. The MPM will help the developers to understand the project's structure as they are onboarded. In addition, the MPM will provide details regarding any maintenance tasks, troubleshooting tips, and useful resources for those developers.
